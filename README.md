# billiards-python-project
Final project for python course

Panda3d is required for run this game.

The main runnable file is "billiards_main.py"

Now only adding balls and snaping camera to them are avaliable, but I'm working.

You may rotate camera around center of table with left mouse button, zoom with mouse wheel,
with right mouse button you may add balls in random positions to the table.
Also if you press "enter", camera will snap to position of ball which was created first.
In this mode camera automaticly follows your mouse pointer (which is hidden) and 
zoom is unavailable. To retrun to previous mode, press "escape".

If you press "shift" while rotating camera, rotation will be much less. This feature is to take aim better.
