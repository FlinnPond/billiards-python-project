# billiards-python-project
Final project for python course

Panda3d is required for run this game.

The main runnable file is "billiards_main.py"

Now only adding balls and snaping camera to them are avaliable, but I'm working.

You may rotate camera around center of table with left mouse button, zoom with mouse wheel,
Also if you press "enter", camera will snap to position of red ball.
In this mode camera automaticly follows your mouse pointer (which is hidden) and 
zoom is unavailable. To return to previous mode, press "escape".

Choose direction for hit, then hold left mouse button and move mouse to set strength.
Release button and watch.

If you press "shift" while rotating camera, rotation will be much less. 
This feature is to take aim better.
